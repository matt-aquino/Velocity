# Velocity
A custom C++ game engine I'm making following The Cherno's Game Engine series.
A lot of the code will be similar or exactly like his, because I'm following along with the tutorials. 
I do try to do things on my own, or stray away from the tutorial outline to implement features ahead of others.

This exists as a way for me to learn about the architecture of game engines, as I didn't get to take game engine courses in college.
While the engine ***currently only supports OpenGL on Windows***, I would like to make the engine cross-platform and support different rendering APIs to learn how each one works, and how to structure code to handle that capability.

The engine is being updated periodically, so if you would like to see the current progress, check the wiki, or pull the repo and run the engine yourself. If not currently using Visual Studio 2019, like I am, open *GenerateProjects* in a text editor and change "vs2019" to your version, then run the batch file.
